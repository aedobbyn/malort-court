# Malort Court Isn't Fair
  
* Tweets in `data`
* Pics in `pics`


```{r}
library(fs)
library(glue)
library(here)
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
some_pics <- dir_ls(here("pics")) %>% 
  sample(3) %>% 
  str_extract_all("pics.+")

### Top three tweets per year

```{r}
tweets <- read_csv(here("data", "tweets.csv"))

tweets %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  arrange(desc(like_count)) %>% 
  mutate(
    text = text %>% str_replace_all("\\n", "       ")
  ) %>% 
  select(like_count, year, text) %>% 
  slice(1:3) %>% 
  kable()
```

### Methodology if you're curious

* Pull in all tweets that contain some version of "malort court" or "#malortcourt" using this regex `(#*)[Mm]alort(\\s*)[Cc]ourt`
* Figure out what the year, month, and day of the actual malort court was based on the top number of tweets containing the malort court regex
* Clean those tweets up, add year, month, day, whether they happened on the day of an acutal malort court or not, etc.
* Find the first tweet and last tweet of each malort court day (just eyeballed it lol)
* Butttttt, not all malort court tweets have "malort court" in the tweet itself. SO, grab *all* the tweets ever tweeted by the account after the first ever malort court tweet in 2015
* Filter those tweets to ones that happened before the first and last malort court tweets every year, so we don't keep anything that's not malort court-related
* Save that in `data`
* Download and store any pics associated with tweets in the `pics` directory
  * They're named based on `{tweet's status_id}-{tweet's url id}.{url's extension}`
* Yay `r emo::ji("laughing")`
