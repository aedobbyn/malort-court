### Methodology if you’re curious

  - Pull in all tweets that contain some version of “malort court” or
    “\#malortcourt” using this regex `(#*)[Mm]alort(\\s*)[Cc]ourt`
  - Figure out what the year, month, and day of the actual malort court
    was based on the top number of tweets containing the malort court
    regex
  - Clean those tweets up, add year, month, day, whether they happened
    on the day of an acutal malort court or not, etc.
  - Find the first tweet and last tweet of each malort court day (just
    eyeballed it lol)
  - Butttttt, not all malort court tweets have “malort court” in the
    tweet itself. SO, grab *all* the tweets ever tweeted by the account
    after the first ever malort court tweet in 2015
  - Filter those tweets to ones that happened before the first and last
    malort court tweets every year, so we don’t keep anything that’s not
    malort court-related
  - Save that in `data`
  - Download and store any pics associated with tweets in the `pics`
    directory
      - They’re named based on `{tweet's status_id}-{tweet's url
        id}.{url's extension}`
  - Yay 😆
